Application Layer
The application folder acts as a coordinator between the domain layer and external concerns:

DTOs (Data Transfer Objects): These are used to transfer data between layers (dto.AddressRequest, dto.AddressResponse)
Application Services: These implement domain service interfaces and orchestrate the flow of data between external interfaces and the domain layer
Use Cases: These coordinate and execute specific business operations
The application layer uses the domain layer but adds coordination logic to fulfill specific user needs. It translates between external representations (DTOs) and internal domain objects.

Key Differences
Purpose:

Domain: Core business rules and entities
Application: Use cases and coordination
Dependencies:

Domain: No dependencies on external frameworks
Application: Can depend on frameworks and adapters
Knowledge:

Domain: Knows nothing about external concerns (HTTP, DB)
Application: Knows about both domain and external interfaces
In your code, you can see this pattern clearly:

domain/service/AddressService defines the interface with business operations
application/service/AddressService implements that interface, handling DTO conversion and coordinating with repositories
This separation helps maintain clean architecture and makes your code more testable and maintainable by isolating core business logic from infrastructure concerns.
