## Data Architecture

### Database Design

#### Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
```sql

users, user_roles, permissions

-- Product catalog
products, categories, variants, attributes, inventory

-- Order processing
orders, order_items, payments, shipments, returns

-- Customer data
customers, addresses, communication_history, loyalty_points

-- Marketing and campaigns
vouchers, campaigns, segments, email_templates
```

#### Cache Layer (Redis)
```
Session data
Product search results
Inventory levels
Rate limiting data
Temporary authentication tokens
Real-time analytics data
```

#### Search Index (Elasticsearch)
```
Product search index
Customer search index
Order search index
Analytics aggregations
Log data for debugging
```

### Event-Driven Architecture

#### Event Streaming (Kafka)
```
Topics:
- user.events (registration, login, profile_update)
- product.events (created, updated, inventory_changed)
- order.events (created, paid, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- customer.events (created, updated, segment_changed)
- marketing.events (campaign_sent, voucher_used, points_earned)
```

#### Event Handling Patterns
```
Event Sourcing: Complete audit trail for orders and payments
CQRS: Separate read/write models for analytics
Saga Pattern: Distributed transaction handling
Event-driven notifications: Real-time updates across services
```
